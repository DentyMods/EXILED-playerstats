# EXILED-playerstats
# THIS IS ONLY THE BOT PART, NOT THE PLUGIN PART
Rebuild of [PlayerStats by galaxy119](https://github.com/galaxy119/PlayerStats) That removes the "Jokers Playground" messages and makes the ping command functional


# How To Use


###### Simply download the .zip from the release's tab and drag all the files in your current bot folder, I recommend deleting the PlayerStatsBot.json file from the zip since you dont need to change anything in the config
